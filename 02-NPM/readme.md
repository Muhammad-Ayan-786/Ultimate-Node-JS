# NPM — Node Package Manager

## What does "npm" stand for?

**npm** → **Node Package Manager**

---

## What is npm?

- **npm** is like a **Play Store for Node.js** — a central place where you can find thousands of packages.
- **Package** — code that someone has already written, ready-made for common tasks.

### Example

You want to build an app where users type text and the computer reads it aloud. Instead of writing complex text-to-speech code from scratch, you can use a package from npm that someone has already built and shared.

> **Package** = Files of code  
> **npm** = Play Store of packages
